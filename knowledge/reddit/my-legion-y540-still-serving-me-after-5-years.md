# My legion Y540 still serving me after 5 years

Bought this in 2020 during lockdown and have been using it since then, learnt music production on it, blender, unity, programming, video editing. Now I am in my first year college and it's still working smooth as butter, prob because I do take care of it, regularly clearing the SSD, just got it cleaned added new thermal paste and upgraded ram from 8gb to 24gb. Absolutely love this.
